# RB Blog Template
A Simple To Use Template For Blog Style Websites!  
My Website Uses This Template: https://www.rianbergen.com/



#### Site Dependencies
1. This site requires that you have a webserver capable of running at least:
   1. HTML 5, CSS 3, JS 5, PHP 7.3, MYSQL 5.5.60
1. We use TinyMCE for any Edit Fields within the Admin Panel. You will need an API Key which you can get here:
   1. https://www.tiny.cloud/
1. We use HashOver for any comments/discussions on the site. You can visit their site here:
   1. https://www.barkdull.org/software/hashover/



#### How To Install
1. Download the latest Source Code, or, download the latest stable release from GitHub.
1. Copy and Paste all of the Source Files into your Website wwwroot folder. If done correctly, the `.htaccess` file will end up in the wwwroot folder.
1. Open up the `.htaccess` file and change all of the following:
   1. Change every instance of `YOURDOMAIN` with your domain name. Example: My domain name is rianbergen, so, I will change `YOURDOMAIN` with `rianbergen`.
   1. If you do not have an `https` certificate, replace every instance of `https` with `http`. If you do have an https certificate, please ignore this step.
   1. If you do not have `.com` as your top-level domain, replace every instance of `.com` with your top-level domain. Examples: `.net`, `.org`, `.gov`, etc.
1. Open up the `404.html` and `500.html` files and change all of the following:
   1. Change every instance of `YOURDOMAIN` with your domain name. Example: My domain name is rianbergen, so, I will change `YOURDOMAIN` with `rianbergen`. There is one instance of `YOURDOMAIN` in the html title. I changed that to `Rian Bergen` instead.
   1. If you do not have an `https` certificate, replace every instance of `https` with `http`. If you do have an https certificate, please ignore this step.
   1. If you do not have `.com` as your top-level domain, replace every instance of `.com` with your top-level domain. Examples: `.net`, `.org`, `.gov`, etc.
1. Download the latest binaries folder from the latest stable release on GitHub. This will contain a SQL Database File that needs to be imported to your website.
1. Navigate to the following folder `\wwwroot\includes\credentials\` and open up the `credentials.php` file. This file contains all of the global site variables including your SQL Database Credentials (for #4 above) as well as the site dependency credentials.
   1. Change every instance of `YOURDOMAIN` with your domain name. Example: My domain name is rianbergen, so, I will change `YOURDOMAIN` with `rianbergen`.
   1. Change `hostname`, `port`, `database`, `user`, and `password` to your SQL Database Credentials.
   1. Change `key` to your TinyMCE Link. It should look something like: https://cloud.tinymce.com/5/tinymce.min.js?apiKey=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   1. Change `absolute` to your website's absolute URL.
   1. If you change CSS files, please make sure to update the CSS Version to a new number. This bypasses any cached files someone may have.
   1. Change `title` and `description` (under the HTML Values Section) to the html title and description that you want.
   1. Change `title`, `description`, `copyright` (under the Titlebar Values Section). `title` refers to the Header and Footer Title Bar. `description` refers to the descirption underneath the Header Title Bar. `copyright` is displayed at the bottom of the page.
   1. Change `email-address@email.com` and `admin name` to your admin information. This address will recieve emails concerning Comments, Subscribe/Unsubscribe, and Contact Requests.
1. HashOver also keeps a file containing Credentials. This file can we found in `\wwwroot\hashover\backend\classes\secrets.php`
   1. You can find more information at: https://docs.barkdull.org/hashover-v2/setup#required-setup/
   1. It will also require you to make a second sql database. This database can be empty as HashOver will fill it out on startup.
1. To install your own images, please go to the following folder `\wwwroot\_res\images\icon` and follow the instructions below.
   1. There are 3 logos within this folder. Please replace those with your own. They should be the exact same sizes and should be named exactly the same. These images appear in the title bar of your browser.



#### How To Use
1. If the installation went correctly, you should see an Under Maintenance Post on your homepage.
1. Going to www.YOUDOMAIN.com/admin (please replace YOURDOMAIN with your actual domain), will bring you to the Admin Panel Login.
   1. Username: Admin
   1. Password: Admin
1. Once Logged In, I recommend that you immediately go to `Users`.
   1. Click the `Edit` Action for the Admin User.
   1. Change the `Username`, `Password`, and `Email` to make sure that your Admin Panel is secure. Make sure to choose a strong password that you can easily remember. Click `Update User` once you are done.
1. After this, I recommend clicking `Pages`. Here you will find all of the Website Specific Pages and the Content that shows up on those pages. I recommend going through each one of them by clicking `Edit` and modifying the content to your liking.
1. To change the About You Image, go to Admin Panel/Images and upload an image of your choosing. You should then be able to go to Admin Panel/Pages/About and change the Banner Image.
