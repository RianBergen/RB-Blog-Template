		Blocking IP Addresses
	</h1>

	<p>
		You can block IP addresses by adding them on the admin "IP Blocking"
		page, or by adding them to the
		<code>/hashover/config/blocklist.json</code> file. You may find the
		<code>stores-ip-address</code> setting helpful, this setting controls
		whether each user's IP address is stored with their comments.
	</p>

	<h1 id="spam-protection">
		Enabling Spam Protection
	</h1>

	<p>
		By default, spam protection is only enabled in PHP mode, because
		JavaScript mode is somewhat naturally protected against some forms of
		spam attacks, such as basic automated form filling, while PHP mode is not.
		However, spam protection can be enabled for JavaScript mode as well by
		changing the "Modes to perform SPAM check under" setting to "Both" on the
		admin Settings page, or by adding or changing the
		<code>spam-check-modes</code> setting to <code>both</code> in the
		<code>/hashover/config/settings.json</code> file.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>How it works</b>: HashOver will check whether or not a visitor's IP
		address is in a database of spam server IP addresses maintained at
		<a href="https://stopforumspam.com/">stopforumspam.com</a>, you may also
		use your own local spam IP address database by changing the
		<code>spam-database</code> setting to <code>local</code>. If a visitor's
		IP address is in the database the visitor is most likely a spammer,
		HashOver will exit with a message saying "You are blocked!" while
		disallowing the visitor any interaction with the comments.
